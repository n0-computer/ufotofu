# UFOTOFU

Ufotofu provides APIs for lazily producing or consuming sequences of arbitrary length. Highlights of
ufotofu include

- consistent error handling semantics across all supported modes of sequence processing,
- meaningful subtyping relations between, for example, streams and readers,
- absence of needless specialization of error types or item types,
- fully analogous APIs for synchronous and asynchronous code,
- the ability to chain sequences of heterogenous types, and
- `nostd` support.

You can read an in-depth discussion of the API designs
[here](https://github.com/AljoschaMeyer/lazy_on_principle/blob/main/main.pdf).

## Core Abstractions

Ufotofu is built around a small hierarchy of traits that describe how to produce or consume a
sequence item by item.

A [`Producer`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/sync/trait.Producer.html) provides the
items of a sequence to some client code, similar to the
[`futures::Stream`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.Stream.html) or the
[`core::iter::Iterator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/iter/trait.Iterator.html) traits. Client
code can repeatedly request the next item, and receives either another item, an error, or a
dedicated *final* item which may be of a different type than the repeated items. An *iterator* of
`T`s corresponds to a *producer* of `T`s with final item type `()` and error type `!`.

A [`Consumer`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/sync/trait.Consumer.html) accepts the
items of a sequence from some client code, similar to the
[`futures::Sink`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/sink/trait.Sink.html) traits. Client code
can repeatedly add new items to the sequence, until it adds a single *final* item which may be of a
different type than the repeated items.  A final item type of `()` makes adding the final item
equivalent to calling a conventional
[`close`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/sink/trait.Sink.html#tymethod.poll_close) method.

Producers and consumers are fully dual; the [pipe](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/sync/fn.pipe.html)
function writes as much data as possible from a producer into a consumer.

Consumers often buffer items in an internal queue before performing side-effects on data in larger
chunks, such as writing data to the network only once a full packet can be filled. The
[`BufferedConsumer`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/sync/trait.BufferedConsumer.html) trait
extends the [`Consumer`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/sync/trait.Consumer.html) trait to
allow client code to trigger effectful flushing of internal buffers. Dually, the
[`BufferedProducer`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/sync/trait.BufferedProducer.html) trait
extends the [`Producer`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/sync/trait.Producer.html) trait to
allow client code to trigger effectful prefetching of data into internal buffers.

Finally, the [`BulkProducer`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/sync/trait.BulkProducer.html)
and [`BulkConsumer`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/sync/trait.BulkConsumer.html) traits
extend [`BufferedProducer`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/sync/trait.BufferedProducer.html)
and [`BufferedConsumer`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/sync/trait.BufferedConsumer.html)
respectively with the ability to operate on whole slices of items at a time, similar to
[`std::io::Read`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html) and
[`std::io::Write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Write.html). The
[bulk_pipe](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/sync/fn.bulk_pipe.html) function leverages this
ability to efficiently pipe data â€” unlike the standard library's
[Read](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html) and
[Write](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Write.html) traits, this is possible without
allocating an auxilliary buffer.

## Crate Organisation

The ufotofu crate is split into three high-level modules:

- [`sync`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/sync/index.html) provides APIs for synchronous,
blocking abstractions (think [`core::iter::Iterator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/iter/trait.Iterator.html)),
- [`local_nb`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/local_nb/index.html) provides
[`Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/future/trait.Future.html)-based, non-blocking APIs (think
[`futures::stream::Stream`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.Stream.html))
for *single-threaded* executors, and
- [`nb`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/nb/index.html) provides
[`Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/future/trait.Future.html)-based, non-blocking APIs for
*multi-threaded* executors.

All three modules implement the same concepts; the only differences are whether functions are
asynchronous, and, if so, whether futures implement
[`Send`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/marker/trait.Send.html). In particular, each module has
its own version of the core traits for interacting with sequences.

The [`nb`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/nb/index.html) module lacks most features of the
[`sync`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/sync/index.html) and
[`local_nb`](https://docs.rs/ufotofu/latest/ufotofu/local_nb/index.html) modules, but the core trait
definitions are there, and we happily accept pull-requests.

## Feature Flags

Ufotofu gates several features that are only interesting under certain circumstances behind feature
flags. These API docs document *all* functionality, though, as if all feature flags were activated.

All functionality that relies on the Rust standard library is gated behind the `std` feature flag
(enabled by default).

All functionality that performs dynamic memory allocations is gated behind the `alloc` feature flag
(disabled by default).

All functionality that aids in testing and development is gated behind the `dev` feature flag
(disabled by default).
